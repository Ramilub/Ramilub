About Me
Detail-oriented and analytical individual on the path to becoming a QA Engineer. While
my technical skills are currently at an entry level, I possess a strong ability to detect
patterns, recognize inconsistencies, and think beyond the interface. I identify bugs not
only in digital environments but in everyday systems as well.
I am able to view tasks from multiple angles and don&#39;t get stuck in a single perspective.
This helps me identify non-obvious causes of issues and anticipate user behavior across
different scenarios. I have a deep understanding of psychology—both of individuals and
large-scale social patterns. I observe how people are influenced by systems, interfaces,
algorithms, and I analyze those interactions.
My mindset is not shaped by any specific corporate culture or rigid methodology. This
allows me to easily adapt to your team’s processes, quality standards, and development
cycles.
I regularly interact with artificial intelligence as a tool for learning and reflection. Through
this interaction, I not only absorb knowledge but also challenge and teach the AI to think
in alternative ways. This has helped me cultivate a meta-awareness similar to what is
required of an insightful QA engineer.
Skills
- Manual Testing (currently learning how to write bug reports and test cases)
- Analytical Thinking and Attention to Detail
- Basic SQL (in progress)
- Behavioral and Logical Bug Detection
- UX/UI Analysis: spotting what disrupts or misleads users
- Clear and Honest Written Communication
- Empathy and User Psychology Awareness
- Critical Interaction with AI as a Learning Tool
Core Strengths
- Observational Acuity and Systems Thinking – I notice what others overlook and see the
broader picture.
- Intuitive Bug Sensing – I often detect subtle issues before they surface clearly.
- Deep Analysis – I ask not only &quot;how&quot; but &quot;why,&quot; always seeking the root cause.
- Ethical Integrity – I strive to do what’s right, not just what’s required.
- Learning Through AI – I use AI not just for input, but as a mirror and a tool for
unconventional reasoning.

Current Learning
- Practicing real-world bug report writing
- Studying SQL for data verification
- Learning TestRail, JIRA, and QA process fundamentals
- Preparing to take an intensive QA bootcamp
- Writing reflections and interaction analyses with AI to deepen critical thinking
Background
My past experience was in high-responsibility real-world environments, where attention
and accountability were non-negotiable. That background taught me discipline,
precision, and respect for detail—qualities I now bring into the tech field.
Personal Note
I don’t just want to find bugs. I want to understand the systems behind them—how they
behave, why they fail, and what they reveal. To me, quality is a form of truth. If
something breaks, I don’t just report it—I try to understand its nature.

I regularly practice self-reflection as a tool for both personal and professional growth.
This habit helps me evaluate my decisions, recognize patterns in my thinking, and
continuously refine my approach to problem-solving. In QA, where attention to both
detail and process is vital, this self-awareness allows me to remain adaptive, accurate,
and always open to improvement.
